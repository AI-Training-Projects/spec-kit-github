    GitHub Spec Kit got the next round of updates, and now makes it even easier to corral LLMs to get things done the right way. Commands are better structured, checklists are now there to help you ensure that the right spec details are included, and if you're using Visual Studio Code, the experience just shines there.

You asked, we deliver - here is a "quick" (really stretching the meaning of that word) demo that shows how I used GitHub Spec Kit to add some functionality to an existing project. I used the spec-driven development process to add a reading list to my blog!

    In this video, we discuss GitHub's new Spec Kit, designed to enhance AI-vibe coding by providing detailed specifications and preventing 'AI Hell'. 
    While I think it's a brilliant idea, I also highlight some challenges and why it doesn‚Äôt quite work for me yet. I discuss the importance of planning in software development, offer an in-depth look at the workflow, and share my hybrid approach for efficiently using AI in coding without falling into 'context hell'. Whether you're a developer curious about Spec Kit or just looking for effective coding strategies, this video has valuable insights for you.
